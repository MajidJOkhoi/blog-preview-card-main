## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this project!

This is a coding challenge where the goal is to build a blog preview card and make it look as close to the design as possible.

## The Challenge

Your task is to build out the blog preview card based on the designs provided in the `/design` folder. The challenge includes both mobile and desktop versions of the design.

Your users should be able to see hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page.

## Project Structure

The project includes the following files and folders:

- `/design`: Contains design files for both mobile and desktop versions of the blog preview card in JPG format.
- `/assets`: Contains all the required assets for the project, including images and font files.
- `index.html`: HTML file for the blog preview card.
- `styles.css`: CSS file for styling the blog preview card.

## Building the Project

Feel free to use any tools or workflow you prefer. However, here's a suggested process:

1. Start by looking through the designs to understand how to tackle the project.
2. Write the HTML structure for the blog preview card, focusing on creating well-structured content.
3. Add the base styles for your project, such as font family and font size.
4. Begin styling the top of the page and work your way down, ensuring to match the design as closely as possible.
5. Test hover and focus states for all interactive elements to ensure they're working correctly.

## Deploying the Project

Once you've completed the project, you can host it for free using platforms like GitHub Pages, Vercel, or Netlify. Simply push your code to a public repository and configure the hosting service of your choice.

## Sharing Your Solution

After completing the project, you can share your solution with the community by submitting it on Frontend Mentor. You can also share it on social media platforms like Twitter, LinkedIn, or in developer communities.

Feel free to write a blog post about your experience building the project, sharing your workflow, technical choices, and code snippets.
